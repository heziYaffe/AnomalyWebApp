Project Synopsis & Features/File Structure/ Implementation of Main Files (Backend/Client)


PROJECT SYNOPSIS & Features : A Web application which allows user to upload and data-sets whether as train or test 
                              data and either build mathematical based on this data or test current mathematical models 
                              currentlly stored in the Web app. We also display through a Data Table and Graphs all data loaded so user 
                              can visualize it in a better manner.

Implementation of Main Files (Backend/Client) :
                              
                              InfoServer : A class which takes care of accessing and handling data from FlightGear API
                              
                              FileParser : A function which takes a CSV file and parses it to be used in the 
                                          Application 
                             
                              PanelModel : The Business Logic of the Panel implementation  and and all "first" layer 
                                           components of the application
                             
                              GraphModel : The Business Logic of the Graph implementation and and all "second" layer 
                                           components of the application

                              PanelViewModel : The ViewModel of Panel implementation 

                              GraphViewModel : The ViewModel of the Graph implementation

                              MasterViewModel : The Master Component which runs all other ViewModels conglomerate
                                                into, basically the entire application center onto this component.

                              PanelView :  The View of the Panel , basically the visual implementation of all 
                                           first layer components
                             
                              GraphWindow : The View of the  Graph , allows user to view all second "layer" 
                                            components.
